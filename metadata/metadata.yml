name: 'The VIMMJIPDA: Multi-target tracker with multiple models and visibility'
description: We demonstrate how a variation of the Joint Integrated Probabilistic
  Data Association (JIPDA) with Interacting Multiple Models (IMM) and a visibility
  state can be derived as a special case of the Poisson Multi-Bernouli Mixture (PMBM)
  filter with a hybrid state representation and standard approximations. The proposed
  method is tested on two radar data sets which were recorded during maritime collision
  avoidance experiments. The code used for testing is contained here.
